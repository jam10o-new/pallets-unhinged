# pallets-unhinged
substrate.io pallets I make when I'm bored, may include useful crazy things, useless crazy things, and fun non-crazy things.

# Recommended contribution style:
* Please create an issue for any components you create
* Please use issue templates for any issue you create, you may use blank issues for other discussion
* Commits that touch components should reference their metaissue, eg, a commit that alters `pallet-samsara` should refer to Issue `#4` in it's commit message, unless addressing a specific bug, in which case you should reference the bug issue number INSTEAD.
