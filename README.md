# pallets-unhinged
substrate.io related things I (will) make when I'm bored, may include useful crazy things, useless crazy things, and fun non-crazy things.

See the [Pallets](https://github.com/joshua-mir/pallets-unhinged/issues/1), [Components](https://github.com/joshua-mir/pallets-unhinged/issues/2), or [Tools and Binaries](https://github.com/joshua-mir/pallets-unhinged/issues/3)

# Recommended contribution style:
* Please create an issue for any components you create
* Please use issue templates for any issue you create, you may use blank issues for other discussion
* Commits that touch components should reference their metaissue, eg, a commit that alters `pallet-samsara` should refer to Issue `#4` in it's commit message, unless addressing a specific bug, in which case you should reference the bug issue number INSTEAD.
* In this house we add features and fix bugs in branches and squash commits on merge.
* New features should only be merged to the `onfire` branch, bugfixes and other miscellanea may be merged to any branch.
