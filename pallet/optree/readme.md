# optree

efficient commutative data-structure and interfaces to it for representing operations to an arbitrary state machine with an evolving opset.

export, import, and merge arbitrary subsets and supersets of optrees into other optrees, use operation-based instead or account-based state pruning.

all optrees are ops.

(should provide runtime apis to allow use in gossip/consensus)
